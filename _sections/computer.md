## Computer Setup <time class='estimate'>3-6 hours</time>

### Hardware

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs, but I **strongly** recommend getting 8 GB of RAM.

Here are the current [MacBook Air models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html) and [MacBook Pro models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/). Your MacBook MUST be running OS X El Capitan. This is free upgrades from the App Store.

Do not go with the new, skinny 12" Retina MacBooks. Their processor will be too sluggish in a year or two.

### Operating System

You'll need to install OS X El Capitan if your Mac didn't have it pre-installed or you haven't upgraded already.

1.  Download the El Capitan upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12).
2.  You'll need to sign in to your Mac's 'App Store' with your [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/).
3.  Double-click "Install OS X El Capitan" to begin installation.  
*WARNING*: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Additional Software

_There is no commercial software required for the class._ However, there are many open source software requirements.

As soon as possible after receiving your Mac, run through the following steps. If you've done a lot of your own configuration, some of these steps may have to change. If you run into **any problems**, send me an e-mail at: [{{site.instructor_email}}](mailto:{{ site.instructor_email }}) and I will try to help.

#### Install a code editor

You will need a program specifically designed for software development. We typically call this an IDE (an Integrated Development Environment).

Sublime is not necessarily the best editor, but it has great defaults. If you are already using an editor and are comfortable with it then you may continue to use it. However, there may be times in class when I suggest a shortcut or editor configuration option that may be different for you! Good alternatives include: Atom, Textmate, and MacVim.

To install Atom:

  1. Download Sublime from [the Sublime website](https://www.sublimetext.com).
  1. Install it. If you're not familiar with Mac installations, [read more here](http://www.howtogeek.com/177619/how-to-install-applications-on-a-mac-everything-you-need-to-know/).

#### Install Google Chrome

While the end users of our applications will use a variety of browsers, I have found that Google Chrome is currently the best option for developing (and testing) our front end applications.

  1. Download Chrome from [the Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).
  1. Install and run it.
  1. Optionally, you may want to set Chrome as your [default browser](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en).

#### Install Homebrew

Homebrew will make it easier for us to install other applications we will need during class.

  1. Open up the iTerm application
  1. Run:  
  `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

#### Install Node.js

Node.js is a technology we will use many times in class. You will learn more about it later.

  1. Open up the iTerm application
  1. Run:  
  `brew install nodejs`
  1. Run:  
  `node -v` to see that you have Node.js installed (you should see a version number print out)

#### Install git

  1. Open up the iTerm application
  1. Run:  
  `brew install git`
  1. Run:  
  `git --version` to see that you have it installed (you should see a version number print out)
  1. Run:  
  `git config --global push.default simple`
  1. Run:  
  `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain`

You may want to [add the following applications to your Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201730) since we will use them regularly.

  * Sublime
  * Chrome
  * iTerm
